# Binary Search of Sorted Array
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

We found the middle index value and compared it to the search key. We then moved either to the right or left of the middle index depending on if the search key was greater or less than. We then repeated the process.
